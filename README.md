I merge fashion and frontend to craft stylish digital experiences.
With a background in Computer Science and a passion for minimalist design, I bring a unique blend of creative direction and technical execution to the world of fashion tech.

Currently building my expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—while applying design fundamentals through Canva, Figma, and UI/UX principles. Whether it's creating a sleek mockup for a kidswear brand or coding a responsive fashion landing page, my goal is to make fashion feel as intuitive as it looks.

I’ve designed visual content for social media, structured gowns for children, and now I’m leveling up to create interactive, branded digital spaces for fashion-forward brands.

Let’s collaborate if you’re building at the intersection of fashion and tech.
